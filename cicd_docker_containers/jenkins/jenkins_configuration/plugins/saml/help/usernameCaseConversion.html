<div>
    The ID returned from SAML is used as the username for Authorization, which
    is usually case sensitive. To make it easier to match with user definition
    in the policy, the returned value can be converted.
    <ul>
        <li><b>None</b> - will not change return value</li>
        <li><b>Lowercase</b> - convert to lowercase</li>
        <li><b>Uppercase</b> - convert to uppercase</li>
    </ul>
    <b><u>Caution!</u></b> Be aware of case in Authorization strategy as you
     may lose access rights if they do no match.
