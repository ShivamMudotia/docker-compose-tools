<div>If set to true, the plugin validates the keycloak token after
	the access token expires or on each request depending on the access
	token configuration. This is necessary if you want to implement a
	global/single sign out scenario with keycloak, because this plugin does
	not support a back channel logout.</div>

<div>If set to false (default), the plugin only validates the
	keycloak authentication at the beginning of the session. Afterwards no
	validation takes place, so the user could log out in keycloak or the
	access token could timeout in the meantime, but the user stays logged
	in in jenkins. This will be true until the user logs out in jenkins or
	the users session in jenkins times out.</div>
